This post will give you an idea about the internship/FTE interview process, types of questions you can expect, dos and don'ts, and some things that I have experienced and I think are worth sharing.

Hi there! I am Ankur Dubey, final year computer science student at IIT Patna. I recently got a job offer from Avalara. Last year I grabbed internship offers from Arista Networks and Newzera. I have experienced F2F rounds of Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, DE Shaw, Codenation and some other companies as well. So I thought I could share some ideas for people who are preparing for interviews so that they get well aware of what they could expect in the process. 

## The Interview Process
The process is almost similar for every company. Generally, it is a three step process.
1. Online coding round
2. Technical rounds (Telephonic and/or F2F)
3. HR/Managerial round

## Online Coding Round
Coding rounds generally take place on HackerRank. You can get an idea of HackerRank environment by trying this [sample test](https://www.hackerrank.com/test/sample). Other common platforms are HackerEarth, CodeChef, CoCubes, etc. It usually consists of 2-5 coding problems with a time limit of 45-150 minutes.

Coding problems range from easy to moderate difficulty level, but could be implementation heavy at times. Most of these problems can be solved using simple implementation, sorting, binary search, basic DP, tree and graph algorithms (rare). However, the problems could be on a bit tougher side for Codenation, Directi, Google, etc. Most of the time partial scores are also given. So if you are able to pass only some test cases and not able to solve completely, submit it anyway.

Along with coding problems, it may contain some MCQs as well. MCQs can be aptitude questions / CS fundamental questions (from DS/Algo/OS/DBMS/Networks etc.) / Language specific questions (eg. Program outputs / Errors). 

__Do:__ The interviewer in the upcoming rounds might discuss the problems asked in the online round. They have your results with them and probably your code too. So try to remember the problems and solve the problems you couldn't solve during the round. Also, try writing cleaner code. 

__Don't:__ Try not changing windows/tabs and write code in the provided editor. Do not copy code from the internet or cheat from somewhere else. 

## Technical rounds
This is the point where things start getting tense. You can expect anywhere between 1-4 technical rounds. Each of these rounds could be elimination. Each interview can be of 30-60 minutes. Interviewer will have your resume with him and feedbacks from your previous rounds. Generally the interview will begin by the interviewer introducing himself and then will ask you to introduce yourself. After that you can expect something from the following list:
1. Discussion about your project(s) mentioned in the resume. 
2. DS/Algo problem(s). Usually like on [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)/[interviewbit](https://www.interviewbit.com/practice/)/[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/). 
3. Objected oriented programming questions like what is a class, object, encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, etc. Design questions could also be asked like write class for a restaurant. 
4. Programming language specific questions like pointers vs references, operator overloading, how vectors are implemented, what are smart pointers and their types, static keyword, dynamic memory allocation, virtual functions so on. (these are for C++)
4. CS fundamental questions from DBMS, OS, Networks, etc. Some example questions are SQL queries and joins, database design, what is HTTP?, what happens when you type a URL in your browser?, processes and threads, deadlocks etc.
5. Puzzles. Most of them can be found on [geeksforgeeks puzzles](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzles/). 
6. Open ended design problems like design search autocomplete/typeahead, design a train reservations system, design URL shortener, etc.  

__Do:__ Try to put your strong areas in your introduction. This can drive your interview in that directions. Also, for your projects make a table similar to [this](https://i.imgur.com/SRwSVHk.png). Needless to say, practice solving and explaining coding problems on whiteboard/paper, understand OOP concepts along with code/examples to explain, master things mentioned in the above list.
