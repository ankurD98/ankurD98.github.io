This post will give you an idea about internship/FTE interview process, types of questions you can expect, do's and don'ts, and some things that I have experienced and I think are worth sharing.  



## The Interview Process
The process is almost similar for every company. It could be seen as a three step process.
1. Online coding round
2. F2F Technical rounds (could be more than one)
3. HR/Managerial round
